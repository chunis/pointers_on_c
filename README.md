All the C programs were my answers to the book **Pointers On C**, and wrote
mainly between 2009.10.28~11.30, as I added it at the head comments of each
C file.

There are 2 types of names:

* **e**x1.c. This is for "Questions 1".
* **p**x1.c. This is for "Programming Exercise 1".

There are still a few chapters/exercises missing. Hope I can add them and
update others if necessary in the near future.

All source codes are released under GPLv3, but you can use short sections for
any purpose. Commerce usage is forbidded, please contact me first.
